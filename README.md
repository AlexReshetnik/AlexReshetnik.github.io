The task of this project was: to rework the project from resume to react and redux, applying all the new principles of technologies. I really liked using both react and redux, I will continue to study them and I want to develop in this direction. The ideal result is an identical appearance and operation as in the previous resume, which means that all components work correctly with each other.
